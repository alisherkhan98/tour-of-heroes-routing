# RoutingTourOfHeroes

This is the tutorial that you can find on the Angular official docs. It helped me learn basic routing, creating different routing modules in one app, parameters, route guards and asynchronous routing.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
